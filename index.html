<h2 style="background-color:Yellow;font-size:40px;">Spotify Song Rankings</h2>   

<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5SNYRBquEFmAuf1cVXXtGh?si=FwsMD3NESz2al8AsSkYs6g">My Spotify Link</a></p>
        <p> This is the link I will be using for my song rankings. Ie, it's my playlist</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc71AmT_b2k">Mine by Bazzi</a></p>
        <p>1. This is a rather interesting song to start out with. I personally haven't fully listen this song from start to back in ages and what I can safely say is that the song is average. It's mediocre at best and at worst, eh. 5/10</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sHKUpOVMO0">I Fall Apart by Post Malone</a></p>
        <p>2. Man, this song is in my honest opinion, right when Posty started getting good. It's funny this playlist was made a few weeks before the release of Beerbongs and Bentlys and at that time. I wouldn't consider this song all that amazing but now, Oh yeah, This about to bop 8/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKAFK5djSk">See You Again by Wiz Khalifa ft Charlie Puth</a></p>
        <p>3. Not really gonna say much about this song, I loved it back when I put it on my playlist, but nowadays not so much. 70% of the time now, it's a skip from me 4/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-xVwxqjNyI">Lights Down Low by MAX ft gnash</a></p>        
        <p>4. Fuck You. 2/10 (on a side note, time has not been nice to this song)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0lw3qylVfY">Unsteady by X Ambassadors</a></p>         
        <p>5. This song works? I don't fully know, I know that I enjoy this song but on it's own it feels kinda eh. I do love the typewriter sound in the background. 5/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuqtOIORPxo">U-RITE by THEY. (Rynx remix)</a></p>            
        <p>6. This song would benefit so much if it was cut down by like 30 seconds. Works rather well for Vanoss's first publicly released song and it's a banger I do enjoy listening to. 6.5/10 </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwfoyVa980U">How Long by Charlie Puth</a></p>  
        <p>7. It's sad how charlie puth went from this and attention. To the abosolutly awful I Hope Remix. 8/10 </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC4xMk98Pdc">Congratulations by Post Malone ft Quavo</a></p>  
        <p>8. Prepare for a whole lotta post malone on this list, While I did say that I Fall Apart was the song I felt he started getting good. This song does well as a good celebratory song. Though It's not my first pick when it comes to that. 7/10 </p>
