        <h1 style="background-color:Orange;font-size:40px;">Spotify Song Ranking</h1>
  <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5SNYRBquEFmAuf1cVXXtGh?si=FwsMD3NESz2al8AsSkYs6g">My Spotify Link</a></p>
        <p> This is the link I will be using for my song rankings. Ie, it's my playlist</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc71AmT_b2k">Mine by Bazzi</a></p>
        <p>1. This is a rather interesting song to start out with. I personally haven't fully listen this song from start to back in ages and what I can safely say is that the song is average. It's mediocre at best and at worst, eh. 5/10</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sHKUpOVMO0">I Fall Apart by Post Malone</a></p>
        <p>2. Man, this song is in my honest opinion, right when Posty started getting good. It's funny this playlist was made a few weeks before the release of Beerbongs and Bentlys and at that time. I wouldn't consider this song all that amazing but now, Oh yeah, This about to bop 8/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKAFK5djSk">See You Again by Wiz Khalifa ft Charlie Puth</a></p>
        <p>3. Not really gonna say much about this song, I loved it back when I put it on my playlist, but nowadays not so much. 70% of the time now, it's a skip from me 4/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-xVwxqjNyI">Lights Down Low by MAX ft gnash</a></p>        
        <p>4. Fuck You. 2/10 (on a side note, time has not been nice to this song)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0lw3qylVfY">Unsteady by X Ambassadors</a></p>         
        <p>5. This song works? I don't fully know, I know that I enjoy this song but on it's own it feels kinda eh. I do love the typewriter sound in the background. 5/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuqtOIORPxo">U-RITE by THEY. (Rynx remix)</a></p>            
        <p>6. This song would benefit so much if it was cut down by like 30 seconds. Works rather well for Vanoss's first publicly released song and it's a banger I do enjoy listening to. 6.5/10 </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwfoyVa980U">How Long by Charlie Puth</a></p>  
        <p>7. It's sad how charlie puth went from this and attention. To the abosolutly awful I Hope Remix. 8/10 </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC4xMk98Pdc">Congratulations by Post Malone ft Quavo</a></p>  
        <p>8. Prepare for a whole lotta post malone on this list, While I did say that I Fall Apart was the song I felt he started getting good. This song does well as a good celebratory song. Though It's not my first pick when it comes to that. 7/10 </p> 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEI4qSrkPAs">Can't Feel My Face by The Weeknd</a></p>   
        <p>9. This is the better verison of Blinding Lights. 7.5/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBkHHoOIIn8">Feel It Still by Portugal. The Man</a></p>  
        <p>10. While these guys may be a one hit wonder now, their song Feel It Still, is still a groovy piece of music that I really enjoy. 8/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aatr_2MstrI">Symphony by Clean Bandit ft Zara Larsson</a></p> 
        <p>11. This song is good, It's enjoyable, but it's not my first pick when it comes to a clean bandit song. That crown goes to Rather Be, but none the less good song 5/10 </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLsTskih7_I&list=PLegvV8yC11jYCS93dMoNw7N2aeF4DPgeR">White Iverson by Post Malone</a></p>  
        <p>12. This song only works when I'm in the mood for it, if i'm not. UGHHHHH it is a boooooooooooore. 3.5/10 </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au2n7VVGv_c">Psycho by Post Malone ft Ty Dolla $ign</a></p>  
        <p>13. Can we agree that Ty Dolla $ign brings this song from a 7 to a 4? </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQjsAJhsSw8">Go Flex by Post Malone</a></p>  
        <p>14. This marks the beginning of, Hey I'm not shit talking Post Malone. Cause THIS IS A REALLY CHILL SONG. The gutair works well and the chorus, ooooooh 8/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFa5We6zqw">In The Night by The Weeknd</a></p>  
        <p>15. The second best weeknd song. Not much else to say. 9/10 </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sENM2wA_FTg">It's Time by Imagine Dragons</a></p>  
        <p>16. Can I say that Imagine Dragons first two albums were great? Cause Yeah, they were. 7.5/10 </p>
